// Leetcode 268. Missing Number

        brute force = check every number + 1 present or not

        Note:
        * all numbers start from 0 
        * all numbers are unique 

        optimal:
        1. save the array into a Set
        2. check if current "i" is in set or not 
        (include n, as given in question) 
        (since 0 is included and 1 number between 0 and n is missing)

        O(n) time
        O(n) space
