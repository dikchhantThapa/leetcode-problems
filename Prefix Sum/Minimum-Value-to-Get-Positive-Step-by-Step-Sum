// Leetcode 1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum

class Solution {
    public int minStartValue(int[] nums) {
        /**
        
        brute force:
        sort it 
        take the lowest number, 
        ans = | lowest no.| + 1 
            = |-4| + 1
            = 5  

        Optimal solution:
        find the lowest number, but by using the Math.min method instead 

        -3  2   -3  4   2
        -3  -1  -4  0   2 
        
        find the lowest value, 

        if negative, 
        | -4 | + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 

        (absolute value)
        | lowest number | + 1  

        if positive, return 1 

        return -min + 1       // -min is the same as Math.abs(minValue)

        // --- return statement explanation: 
          since default min = 0, automatically if there's no negative numbers, 0 will be set as lowest
          -0 + 1 = 1 (so for any postive numbers, always 1 is returned)

          only for negative numbers, it is changed into absolute value and then 1 is added to it and returned
          example in the above array, :
          -(-4) + 1
          = 4 + 1
          = 5 

        O(n) time
        O(1) space 
        
         */

        int min = 0; 
        int total = 0; 

        for (int num: nums) {
            total += num;
            min = Math.min(min, total);   
        }

        return -min + 1;        // explanation above 


    }
}
